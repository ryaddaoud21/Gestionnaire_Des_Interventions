Geocoder
========

This is a Django app that lets you load Ordnance Survey data and use it to find places.

A list of ``Places`` from the Ordnance Survey is stored in a spatial database, and a url is provided to query them by name and return a JSON response containing matching places. Useful for autocompleting inputs that take town, city or road names.

In addition, the places are filtered by a series of bounding boxes, so that only places within the supplied boxes are returned.


Prerequisites
-------------
* A GeoDjango (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/gis/tutorial/#introduction) project (Note, this has only been tested with Django 1.4.5 and a PostGIS database)


Installation
------------
1. Add ``geocoder`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` list in settings.py
2. Import the geocoder ajax url into your project's urls.py
3. Set ``GEOCODER_BOUNDING_BOXES`` to include one or more bounding boxes
4. Run ``python manage.py syncdb``
5. Restart your web server, if necessary.
